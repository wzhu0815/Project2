# PROJECT 2: FLIGHT DELAYS & CANCELLATIONS

Team: Wei Zhu, Irene Okada, Adam Katz, Desiree Diaz


# Our goal is to develop an interactive website that allows web-users to easily navigate the website and gather the information they are seeking while remaining engaged with the site. 

# We decided to review flight delays and cancellations from various airlines and airports in the United States. Although there is a lot of data containing flight delays and cancellation, we sourced the data from Kaggle.com and analyzed it for January 1, 2018.
